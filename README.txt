A library for textual manipulation.

mistranscribe.js mutablizes text. It's extensible (you can easily add more abilities to it). It's packaged as a jQuery plugin, because I like jQuery. It requires underscore.js because the code looks prettier that way. All the good bits are just plain old javascript though, so you shouldn't have any trouble porting it to the environment of your choice.
