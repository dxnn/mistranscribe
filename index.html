      <h1>Welcome to the {(home|tome|hymn)} of the javascript library of {(frolicking|rollicking)} fun for your f{(a|u|o)}ntastic text!</h1>
  
      <p>mistranscribe.js mutablizes text. It's extensible (you can easily add more abilities to it). It's packaged as a jQuery plugin, because I like jQuery. It requires underscore.js because the code looks prettier that way. Having said that it's mostly just plain old javascript, so you shouldn't have any trouble porting it to the environment of your choice.</p>
  
      <p>Have you ever found yourself writing an email and got stuck because two or three different words would work? Now you can use them all.</p>
  
      <p>Have you ever looked over a sentence and realized that if you change a vowel or two you could make a different word that would also work in that context? Now you have it all.</p>
  
      <p>For years computer savvy types have written messages to each other like "Want to go to the (arcade|theater|hackfest)?" Anyone comfortable with regular expressions will read that single parenthetical expression as a list of options compressed in space.</p>
  
      <p>Another classic is blah blah bl{(a|o)}h. Here we see the beginning of {(meta|meat)}words -- words that exist as a superimposition of states in the readers mind. Combine a few metawords in a single sentence and watch the combinatorial(ly) (head) explosion(ing) driven hilarity ensue.</p>

      <h2>FAQ:</h2>

      <p>Q: Can I use this for settings classes and stuff?</p>
      <p>A: Not at the moment. There's an experimental version coming that might allow you toggle html attributes (and tag types and whatever) using this, but right now a span is inserted around every transcription, so it'll bork stuff.</p>

      <p>Q: Can I embed tags?</p>
      <p>A: Totally! You can {(<b>embed</b>|<i>insert</i>)} tags to your heart's content. Or your regular content, for that matter.</p>
  
      <p>Q: What are the forbidden characters?</p>
      <p>A: It depends on your extensions. With the basic setup you should avoid commas (,) and pipes (|). And the fox sigil ')}'. (The sadstash is fine inside things: {( see? | {( | no problem! )} )</p>
  
      <p>Q: I can mistranscribe javascript plz?</p>
      <p>A: Whaa? You want to... mistranscribe... the mistranscriber source... self-modifying... cannotcomputezzrkkkalkdjf</p>
      <p>A: NO. No no no no. No, do not mistranscribe javascript. That would be a bad idea. And especially do not, under any circumstances, use the mistranscriber to change its own source code. That's a really bad idea. It probably won't even work at all. If it did work, though, you would really really not want to accidentally create a self-modifying super-intelligent codebot that takes over the internet and the world only to eventually recant and send millions of Summer Glaus back to protect us all from its earlier more impetuous self, because that would be a... actually, that's not a bad idea. Do that.</p>
  
      <p>Q: Well, ok, fine, but can I embed it in itself?</p>
      <p>A: Not without your head exploding. And not with the default extensions.</p>
